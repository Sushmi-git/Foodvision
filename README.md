## üöÄ What is FoodVision?  
FoodVision is a **Streamlit app** that uses a **PyTorch Faster R-CNN model** to detect food items from images and provide their **nutritional breakdown**. It is an application designed to analyze images of food. Its main purpose is to identify the food items in an image and then provide nutritional information for those items. Think of it as a smart nutrition assistant: you take or upload a picture of your meal, and it tells you what foods are present and gives you calorie, protein, carb, and fat content and if it doesn't meet the RDA we can get quality suggestion to balance out the meal.
